An automatic camera records the number of cars running a red light at an intersection (that is, the cars were going through when the red light was against the car). Analysis of the data shows that on average 15% of light changes record a car running a red light. Assume that the data has a binomial distribution. What is the probability that in 20 light changes there will be exactly three (3) cars running a red light?
